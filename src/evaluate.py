# =============================================================================
# src/evaluate.py — DVC Pipeline Stage 3: Evaluation + Quality Gate
# =============================================================================
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#   1. Loads the trained model saved by train.py
#   2. Evaluates it on the test set
#   3. Enforces a QUALITY GATE — fails with exit code 1 if accuracy is too low
#   4. Writes metrics to metrics.json (DVC can read this for `dvc metrics show`)
#
# THE QUALITY GATE IS THE KEY TEACHING POINT:
#   In GitHub Actions CI, this script runs after every push.
#   If the model doesn't meet the minimum accuracy, the CI workflow FAILS.
#   This prevents a bad model from ever reaching the registry.
#
#   Think of it as: unit tests for your model's performance.
#
# HOW TO RUN (standalone):
#   python src/evaluate.py
#
# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
#   Accuracy 0.8150 >= threshold 0.78 -> PASS
# =============================================================================
