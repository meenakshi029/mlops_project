# =============================================================================
# src/train.py — DVC Pipeline Stage 2: Model Training + MLflow Tracking
# =============================================================================
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#   1. Loads the processed feature matrix from preprocess.py
#   2. Trains a Decision Tree classifier
#   3. Logs EVERYTHING to MLflow: params, metrics, the model artifact
#   4. Saves the trained model to models/ (tracked by DVC)
#
# HOW IT FITS INTO THE PIPELINE:
#   features.csv → [THIS SCRIPT] → mlruns/ (MLflow) + models/dt_model.pkl
#
# HOW TO RUN (standalone):
#   python src/train.py
#   Then open: mlflow ui  (in a new terminal)
#   Open browser: http://localhost:5000
#
# KEY TEACHING POINT:
#   Every time this runs, MLflow creates a new "run" with a unique ID.
#   You can change max_depth in params.yaml, run again, and compare
#   both runs side by side in the MLflow UI — without overwriting anything.
